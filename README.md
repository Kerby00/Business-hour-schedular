# Business-hour-schedular
This repo contains the final code for a standard business hour schedular. On the application you will find a current date at the top, and 9 hourblock from 9-5pm. In marked hours you are able to write and create notes for each hour. To the right of the textareas you will find a save button, upon clicking your user input will be saved to localstorage with what hour you wrote for. The same localstorage is pulled and applied to keep users input at each hour even after refreshing or closing and opening the application. There is also an added feature that color codes each hour compared to real time. Gray for past hours, red for current hour, and green for upcoming hours.
